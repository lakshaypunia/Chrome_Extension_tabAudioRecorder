## üöÄ Local Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the extension and the local test server running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or newer recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the project from GitHub to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lakshaypunia/Chrome_Extension_tabAudioRecorder.git
cd Chrome_Extension_tabAudioRecorder
### Step 2: Install Dependencies

You'll need to install dependencies for both the extension frontend and the backend server.

#### For the Extension (Frontend):

```bash
# Navigate to the root directory of the project
npm install
```

### Step 3: Build the Extension

To create the production-ready extension files, run the build command from the root directory. This will generate a `dist` folder containing all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

```bash
# From the root directory
npm run build
```

## üîß Installing the Chrome Extension Locally

With the `dist` folder generated, you can now load the extension into Chrome.

1. **Open Chrome Extensions**: Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.

2. **Enable Developer Mode**: In the top-right corner of the page, toggle the "Developer mode" switch on.

3. **Load the Extension**: 
   - Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears on the top-left.
   - A file selection dialog will open.
   - Navigate to your project directory and select the `dist` folder.
   - Click "Select Folder".

The Tab Audio Recorder extension should now appear in your list of extensions, and its icon will be available in the Chrome toolbar!
